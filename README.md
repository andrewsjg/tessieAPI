# tessieAPI

This is a very simple Go package that provides an interface to the [Tessie](https://developer.tessie.com) API

[Tessie](https://www.tessie.com) is a mobile app that integrates with the Tesla API to provide enhanced application and automation features for your Tesla vehicles. They provide a nice API which enables you to programatically access many aspects of your car(s).

I am mostly creating this package to use in my own projects, but if you have a use or find it useful then you are more than welcome to use it.

Ititially this package will only support the passive/read-only API endpoints and mostly only endpoints that provide state information about the car.
